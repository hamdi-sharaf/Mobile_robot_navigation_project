# Mobile_robot_navigation_ROS_project
The goal of this project is to program a robot that can autonomously
map an environment and navigate to the target location without
hitting obstacles.
The tasks involved in the project are as follows:
*Convert my project robot from Fusion360 to ROS as a URDF model,
adding sensors and necessary plugins.
* Designed and built simple simulation home world with Gazebo
Building Editor.
* Generated the map of the environment by using gmapping SLAM
package.
* Localize the robot in the world by using AMCL package.
* Utilised the ROS navigation stack and command the robot to go to
different desired positions by using 2D Nav Goal.
